# FastAPI

This application demonstrates a basic setup for managing blog posts using FastAPI. 

It includes endpoints for creating, retrieving (all, latest, and specific), updating, and deleting posts. The use of Pydantic for data validation ensures that the input data is correctly structured, and FastAPI's built-in exception handling provides meaningful error messages for invalid operations.
